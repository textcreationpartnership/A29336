            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF Neceſſity, which is a great Branch of the Law of Nature, did not preſs us at this time, to come to ſome ſpeedy and pertinent Determinations, as to the buſineſs, eſpecially, of Settling the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that nicety, which ſeems to be promoted and ſet afoot in all our Counſels, might, conſidering the weightineſs of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

in hand, rather claim the Juſt Commendation and Applauſes of every good Man, than, as it ſeems now, fall under their Cenſure; and I may ſay, Indignation. If the matter Debated were extraneous, and the Kingdom within it ſelf peaceably, and firmly ſettled; if the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our Affairs were ordinary and uſual, and could admit of an unlimited time for their Deciſion; if we were ſecure from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious Reſolutions of our Enemies abroad, or from the private Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of Diſ-affected Perſons at home: If theſe things were ſo, it were worthy the Wiſdom of thoſe, who by their unſeaſonable Scruples (ſo generally reſolv'd againſt, and now again by them ſtarted) may ſeem either ignorant of the deſperate languiſhing condition of theſe Kingdoms at preſent, or prejudic'd and diſ-affected to the peace and ſettlement of them for the future; I ſay, it were then worthy the Wiſdom of theſe men, to diſſect every particular of ſo Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant an Affair, before they made any Determination of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. As we all acknowledge the extraordinary circumſtances of this juncture, ſo they themſelves have not been a little contributing to this Happy Revolution: The Princes firſt Declaration tells us, he had the Invitation of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. Was it Juſtice and agreeable to Conſcience then, to call for Foreign Arms to aſſiſt us, againſt our own King, in the recovery of thoſe Rights, Liberties and Properties, which contrary to Law, he had Invaded, and taken from us? And is it now become a Scruple in thoſe ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, to be confirm'd in thoſe Rights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the ſame Arms and Power? Is that pretended, abſolute, unlimited Power, which in their Prayers and Sermons they have ſo often nibbled at, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to retrench, now, in its <hi>juſt debaſement</hi> become ſo Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable and Sacred, that it muſt become a Point of Faith entirely to ſubmit to it? Has this ſmall fit of fear and diſcouragement in our implacable Enemies, ſo well ſecur'd us from any future encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that we need not be careful of any further Aſſurance? Has theſe men's Re-embelliſh'd Honours ſo obliterated the memory of the Dangers ſome of them ſo lately have eſcap'd, and the reſt juſtly fear'd, as to free them from all apprehenſions for the future? What is it theſe Gentlemen would be at? What do they fear? Is it without Reaſon, without Juſtice, without Preſident, that we defire to be

everlaſtingly ſecur'd from POPERY and SLAVERY? Not without Reaſon; for when we have ſeen many of our faireſt Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Lopp'd off, many of our Liberties Invaded, many of our Laws Perverted, and the Axe at laſt laid to the Root of our Government, 'tis high time then, I ſay, to provide for our Safety, and to put a ſtop to that current which would have quickly over-run and drowned us; not without Juſtice, for where my Life and Property is hunted after, and Aſſaulted, I may, by the Law of God and Man, repel the Injury, and ſtand in my own Vindication; not without Preſident, even in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Kingdoms (not to mention the Romaniſts who both teach and practiſe the Depoſing of Evil and Wicked Magiſtrates;) and though in <hi>England</hi> we may perhaps think the changes we have very lately ſeen among our ſelves admit of no Preſident, it may eaſily be prov'd that what hath been done of late in this Nation, hath been in great part formerly preſented and <hi>allowed</hi> of upon Foreign Stages; yea, and not many years out of the memory of ſome yet living, if we would but look into the Actions of other Regions, and thoſe too wherein the Reform'd Religion is profeſſed, we ſhall find that they, by their publick Records, acknowledged that in caſe of Tyranny and Oppreſſion, it was lawful not only to defend their Lives and Liberties againſt all Aſſaults, but reduce and declare the perſons ſo offending, incapable of holding the Government. A lively exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this, and almoſt exactly parellel with ours, was the Caſe of <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the III. Hereditary King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who by a Convention of the States of that Kingdom, was Excluded even with his Heirs, (a ſeverity which both the Honourable Houſes of Parliament here have with great Juſtice and Wiſdom declin'd,) from that Crown for ever: Some of the Articles drawn up againſt him were theſe; firſt, For ſwerving from their received Chriſtian Religion; as alſo, from his Oath and Promiſe, and Solemn Engagement made to his People at his Coronation, to Preſerve their Rights and Priviledges; as alſo, their Holy Reform'd Religion Inviolated; for departing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try without the conſent, and unwilling to the States and Orders of the Realm; for exporting ſeveral Acts of great concernment out of the Cancellarie; for proſecuting ſuch as would not embrace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Romiſh Superſtition; for contemning and endeavouring to

               <!-- PDF PAGE 18 -->
Undermine and Annul thoſe laudable Inſtitutions and Laws made for the ſecurity of the Realm, and the Eſtabliſhment of the Proteſtant Reform'd Religion; for raiſing up what Enemies he could againſt his Native Country, thereby to involve his Subjects in a deluge of Blood, which he intended, and had almoſt effected; for inhumanely deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſuborning Ruſſians and Villains, to Murder and Aſſaſſinate one of the chief Nobles, for no other reaſon, but that out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Duty he would have perſwaded him from thoſe Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities and Notorious Breaches, of the known Laws of the Land. For theſe and many more Cauſes, as <hi>the ſending his Son out</hi> of the Land, without the conſent of the States, and cauſing him to be brought up and Educated in the Romiſh Superſtition, did the <hi>Swedes</hi> (ſubmitting the ſame to the judgment of all ſincere and candid Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tratours) juſtifie their abdication for ever, of King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> III. and his Heirs, from the Crown of <hi>Sweden, &amp;c.</hi> and proceeded ſtrait to the Conſtituting and Electing of <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Sudermannia; vid.</hi> Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim<hi>'s hiſt. of</hi> Sweden, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in concluſion, they pray for and doubt not of a ſincere and candid Conſtruction, a benign and favourable Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, from all Chriſtian Emperours, Kings, Princes, States, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of this their Legitimate Defence, and to Vindicate them and their moſt equal Cauſe from all Calumny, or Evil Interpretation whatſoever. The Circumſtances relating to this preſent juncture in <hi>England,</hi> bear ſo near a reſemblance almoſt in all thoſe Grievances objected againſt the ſaid <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> that our late King by a ſort of <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſeems to have breath'd his Soul rather than to have Copy'd after him, though indeed in ſome caſes, he has plainly out-done the Original, eſpecially in relation to his ſuppoſed Son. And as our King thought ſit to Copy a King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> I cannot apprehend how it can leſſen our Judgments or Integrity, our Piety, or our Loyalty, to follow the example of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> excepting in the caſe of the Lawful Heirs (whom every good <hi>Engliſhman</hi> and Proteſtant, to their utmoſt Danger and Peril, are ready to defend and maintain) to take ſuch meaſures for our future Security, and lawful Eſtabliſhment, as ſhall not by any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Art or Endeavour, be liable to Interruption.</p>
